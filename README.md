**DupeChest** is a high-tier expansion that introduces the ultimate reality-bending utility to your Minecraft world. Rewriting the laws of the matrix, this mod allows you to duplicate your most precious items—at a legendary cost.

## 🌌 What's in the Mod

The mod centers around the **Dupe Chest**, a custom block entity designed for end-game progression:

* **The Dupe Chest**: A unique storage block that duplicates items placed within it.
* **Short on resources?** Missing that one piece of Redstone for a torch? Just dupe it!
* **Left your stash behind?** Forgot your 67 stacks of Emerald Blocks at home? Don't worry, just dupe 'em!
* **NBT Support**: It copies *everything*, including items with **NBT data**—meaning you can clone fully Enchanted Books and even entire Shulker Boxes!

## 🛠️ Crafting & Progression

To prevent world-breaking imbalances, the Dupe Chest requires a massive 9-item shapeless recipe consisting of the rarest artifacts in the game:

* **Ingredients**: Dragon Egg, Dragon Head, Mace, Silence Armor Trim, Music Disc (Pigstep), Conduit, Creeper Head, Piglin Head, and an Enchanted Golden Apple.
* **Recipe Book**: As soon as you obtain a **Dragon Egg**, the recipe will automatically unlock in your green recipe book.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To begin your journey into the matrix, you must defeat the strongest bosses and raid the deepest structures to gather the 9 required components. Once crafted, place the chest and witness the laws of reality rewrite themselves.
